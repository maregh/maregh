My name is Maria (AKA peanut butter pickle sandwhich girl)


I am in my 3rd year of a ✨*neuroscience*✨ degree

I enrolled in Neural Data Science because I really want to be able to understand raw eeg data and not just see squiggles...

Interested in neuroscience from psych and noticed the neuro program was very similar to the psych program here at dal, so i figured why not try!

I'm into biotech and innovation
